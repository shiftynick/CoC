# Catalog of Complexity: Project Plan

## 1. Project Phases

### Phase 1: Identification and Initial Cataloging

- Identify existing complexity systems
- Catalog known properties and attributes of complex systems
- Create a preliminary taxonomy of complex systems

### Phase 2: Structuring and Classification

- Develop a standardized format for cataloging systems and properties
- Implement a classification system for complex systems
- Create relationships between systems and properties

### Phase 3: Framework Development

- Design a framework for analyzing complex systems using the catalog
- Develop methodologies for applying the catalog to various domains
- Create tools for navigating and visualizing the catalog

## 2. Document Overview

1. `ComplexitySystems.md`: A comprehensive list of identified complex systems
2. `ComplexityProperties.md`: A catalog of properties and attributes of complex systems
3. `Taxonomy.md`: A preliminary taxonomy of complex systems
4. `CatalogFormat.md`: Standardized format for cataloging systems and properties
5. `ClassificationSystem.md`: Detailed classification system for complex systems
6. `RelationshipMap.md`: Mapping of relationships between systems and properties
7. `AnalysisFramework.md`: Framework for analyzing complex systems using the catalog
8. `DomainApplications.md`: Methodologies for applying the catalog to various domains
9. `CatalogTools.md`: Description of tools for navigating and visualizing the catalog

## 3. Timeline and Milestones

- Week 1-4: Phase 1 - Identification and Initial Cataloging
- Week 5-8: Phase 2 - Structuring and Classification
- Week 9-12: Phase 3 - Framework Development
- Week 13-14: Review, refinement, and documentation
- Week 15-16: Final testing and project completion

## 4. Next Steps

1. Begin with creating the `ComplexitySystems.md` and `ComplexityProperties.md` documents
2. Conduct research to populate these documents with initial data
3. Start developing the preliminary taxonomy in `Taxonomy.md`
4. Regular team meetings to review progress and adjust the plan as needed
