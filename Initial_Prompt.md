# Project Overview

This is the Catalog of Complexity, a project that aims to provide a comprehensive and structured approach to catalogging complex systems and their properties/attributes with the goal of classifying and understanding the systems in relation to each other.

The initial steps will be identifying and catalogging existing complexity systems and properties/attributes.

The next steps will be to structure the catalogging of systems and properties/attributes to enable classification and comparison of systems.

The next steps are to develop a framework for using the catalog to understand and navigate complexity in various domains.

# Your task

Your task is to develop a plan and an overview of documents to execute the plan. The output should be a new Plan.md document and stubs for the initial documents that will be created as artifacts of the project.
